# Research Context

## Overview

Answers "given what this repo already does, what is the *current* way to do X?" with fresh external information, grounded against named files in this repo. The output is a short cited brief consumed by `spec-driven-development` (the version-sensitive ambiguity gate) and `implement` (Phase 3).

> **Tool discipline (phase-locked):** `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` and `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` only. Never edit source or test code; the only artifact is the brief. Runs on `sonnet` per `.claude/references/model-routing.md`.

## When To Use

- A spec or plan hinges on a version-sensitive choice, a recent library landscape, a migration path, or current security advisories; or the engineer asks to "research X".
- Not for a known-API question answerable from local sources (read the SDK source or in-repo docs), and not for this codebase's internals (read the code).

## Workflow

1. **Ground before any web call.** Resolve the stack (`bash scripts/resolve-tech-stack.sh "<path>"`), read the **installed version** from the lockfile or project file, and name 1–3 files showing current usage. Frame it: *"For \<stack\> using \<library\>@\<installed-version\>, given this repo does \<X in file:line\>, what is the current recommended way to \<goal\>?"* If the version or a grounding file cannot be found, the brief says so.
2. **Pick depth.** Light path by default: `WebSearch` + `WebFetch` (2–4 fetches) or `context7`. Deep path only for contested or high-stakes questions (security, data integrity, hard-to-reverse migrations): 2–4 parallel research subagents, one angle each. A claim only one subagent found, or that they disagree on, stays `[ASSUMED]` until a fetched source settles it. Without subagents, run the angles sequentially and say so.
3. **Tag every claim** with exactly one tag:
   - `[CITED:<url>]` — a fetched source. Memory is not a source.
   - `[VERIFIED:<file:line>]` — confirmed against this repo and the installed version.
   - `[ASSUMED]` — not confirmed, including any finding for a different major/minor version than the one installed.

   **An `[ASSUMED]` claim that reaches a spec becomes an open decision that blocks `MTK_AUTO_PROCEED` at the `implement` Phase 2.5 gate**, so a human confirms it. Never turn an `[ASSUMED]` claim into a bare assertion.
4. **Emit the brief:**
   ```
   ## Research brief: <framed question>
   **Stack / version:** <stack> · <library>@<version> (from <file>)
   **Grounding files:** <file:line>, ...
   ### Recommendation
   <1–3 sentences for THIS version and repo>
   ### Findings
   - [CITED:<url>] / [VERIFIED:<file:line>] / [ASSUMED] <claim>
   ### Open decisions for the spec/plan
   - <each place current practice diverges from the repo; never resolved silently>
   ### Sources
   - <url> — <what it established>
   ```
   Standalone ("research X"): present it and stop; do not implement. Called by a skill: return it to that skill.
5. **Persist** when `$MTK_WF_UUID` is set: `bash scripts/workflow-artifact.sh event "$MTK_WF_UUID" research_brief --data '{"question":"...","recommendation":"...","conflicts":<n>}'`.

## Verification

- [ ] The question names the stack and installed version, plus a grounding file (or records their absence)
- [ ] Depth chosen per step 2; deep-path disagreements left `[ASSUMED]`
- [ ] Every claim carries exactly one tag; every `[CITED]` has a fetched URL; off-version findings are `[ASSUMED]`
- [ ] Repo-vs-practice conflicts listed as open decisions
- [ ] No code edited; brief returned (or presented and stopped); `research_brief` event recorded when a workflow is active
