# MTK Setup Refresh — Detect Drift, Regenerate Scoped, Propose Diffs

## MTK File Resolution

MTK skills and shared references live either in the project (local install) or the plugin cache (marketplace install). Resolve once:

1. If `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set, prefix `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/references/` reads with it.
2. Otherwise, if `.claude/skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md` exists locally → project-relative paths work as-is.
3. Otherwise, fall back to `find ~/.claude/plugins -maxdepth 8 -name "SKILL.md" -path "*/mtk/*/context-engineering/*" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's|/.claude/skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md||'`. If empty, MTK skills are unavailable — warn the engineer and proceed with `CLAUDE.md` only.

Always project-relative (never prefixed): `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/tech-stack`, `.claude/rules/`, `tasks/`, `docs/`, `.claude/references/architecture-principles.md`, `.claude/references/pre-commit-review-list.md`.

This skill re-runs setup's generators on an already-bootstrapped repo. It never re-audits blind: it consults `scripts/setup-refresh-plan.sh` for a per-artifact staleness verdict, regenerates only what drifted, and — critically — never silently overwrites a file an engineer has hand-edited. Engineer-edited files go through the diff-proposal contract in `.claude/references/regen-diff-contract.md`, the same contract `setup-audit` and `setup-bootstrap` use for their own re-run merges.

## File Preservation Policy

This skill inherits the File Preservation Policy defined in `.claude/skills/setup-bootstrap/SKILL.md` (`## File Preservation Policy`) wholesale — read it before writing anything. In short: only MTK-owned files may be overwritten in place, everything else (nested CLAUDE.md, custom rules, custom references, lockfiles, source) is preserved untouched, and superseding a prior MTK-owned file must be reported loudly, never silent. Refresh must not weaken this contract in any way — it has strictly more ways to go wrong than bootstrap (drift scoping, cached ancestors, diff proposals), and every one of them defaults to preserving what's on disk.

## STEP 0: Preconditions

Require a prior bootstrap:

```bash
test -f .claude/tech-stack || MISSING_TECH_STACK=1
test -f .claude/mtk-version.json || MISSING_VERSION=1
```

If either file is missing, STOP immediately and tell the engineer:

> "This repo has not been bootstrapped yet (`.claude/tech-stack` and/or `.claude/mtk-version.json` missing). Run `/mtk-setup` (full bootstrap) first, then `/mtk-setup --refresh` on future re-runs."

Do not attempt a partial refresh, and do not fall back to generating these files yourself — that is bootstrap's job, not refresh's.

Otherwise, resolve the active stack as usual: read `.claude/tech-stack`, then load `.claude/skills/tech-stack-{stack}/SKILL.md`. Its `## Scan Recipes` section is the input STEP 3 uses when a full re-audit is required.

## STEP 1: Staleness Plan

Run the plan script and read its structured output — this is the sole source of truth for what has drifted:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-refresh-plan.sh --json
```

Parse each artifact row (the script emits full paths: `.claude/references/architecture-principles.md`, `.claude/references/conventions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/detected-tools.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `path-references`, and the informational `.claude/setup-answers.json` row) for its `status` (`fresh` / `stale` / `missing` / `unstamped` / `unknown` / `present` / `absent`) and `reason`. STEP 3 scopes its regeneration entirely from this plan — do not re-derive staleness by re-reading the codebase from scratch. If the plan script itself fails or is not found, STOP and report the failure; do not silently degrade to a full re-audit as a workaround.

## STEP 2: Dry-Run Gate

If `--dry-run` was passed:

1. Re-run `bash scripts/setup-refresh-plan.sh` **without** `--json` and print the resulting plan table verbatim — every row, no reformatting or summarizing away entries (the table format exists only in the default output mode).
2. Follow it with one paragraph describing what a full refresh would do, per stale/missing row (e.g., "`architecture-principles.md` is stale — 4 claims touch changed files under `src/Api/`; a refresh would re-read those files plus their containing modules, regenerate the affected sections, and propose any resulting diff against your on-disk copy per the regen-diff-contract before writing anything").
3. STOP. Write nothing — no docs, no cache entries, no stamps, no `.claude/detected-tools.json` updates.

## STEP 3: Scoped Regeneration

For each artifact the plan marked `stale`, `missing`, or `unstamped`, apply the matching procedure below (`unstamped` docs route to the full-re-audit path — there is no stamp to scope by). Skip rows marked `fresh` or `unknown` — leave those files exactly as they are. The informational `setup-answers.json` row never drives regeneration; STEP 5 handles it.

**Temp-path mandate:** STEP 3 never writes a regenerated doc to its on-disk path. Every regenerated doc goes to a temp path (e.g. `/tmp/mtk-refresh/<file>`); only STEP 4 — the diff-proposal contract — may touch the on-disk copy. The two exceptions are the deterministic artifacts explicitly listed below (AGENTS.md/tool configs/indexes), whose generators carry their own marker-refusal guards.

### `architecture-principles.md` / `conventions.md`

1. Get the stale-claim scoping input from the same drift source the plan consulted: `bash scripts/audit-drift-check.sh <doc> --json` — its `drift` array pairs each changed path with the claim anchor it touches.
2. Compute the **full** changed-file set yourself (the drift check reports only the changed ∩ cited intersection, which systematically undercounts churn): read the doc's `audited-against:` stamp, then `git diff --name-only <stamp>..HEAD`. Count tracked source files for the active stack (`git ls-files` filtered to stack extensions) as the denominator.
3. **Full re-audit** (re-run `setup-audit`'s STEP 0.5 through STEP 3.7 for this doc, in full) only when: the doc's stamp is missing or unreadable, **or** the full `git diff` changed set from item 2 exceeds ~30% of tracked source files. In that case, treat this as equivalent to a fresh `/mtk-setup --audit` for this one document.
4. **Scoped regeneration** (the default path): re-read only the changed files reported by the drift check, plus the directories/modules that contain them. Re-derive only the principle/convention lines whose evidence anchors point into that changed set. Every other section is carried over **verbatim, byte-for-byte** from the current on-disk doc — do not reword, re-flow, or "improve" untouched sections. This keeps prompt-cache prefixes stable and keeps the diff STEP 4 has to reason about small and honest.
5. Either way, the regenerated doc is written to the temp path, never in place. Run `setup-audit` STEP 3.5 (Provenance section) against the temp copy so `fresh` is complete before classification. Stamping and verify-claims happen in STEP 5, against the on-disk doc **after** STEP 4 has resolved the proposals — the engineer-approved state is what gets stamped and verified, not the unreviewed template.

### `.claude/detected-tools.json`

Re-run `setup-audit` STEP 2.6 (tool detection) only — do not re-run the full scan recipes. Write the result to a temp path first; STEP 4 diffs it against the on-disk copy before deciding whether to overwrite (this file is machine-generated and deterministic, but a manual edit is still possible and must not be clobbered silently).

### Reference pruning

Re-run `setup-bootstrap` STEP 3.6 (prune stack reference files against detected tools) against the freshly regenerated `detected-tools.json`. This may newly ship a reference file that was previously pruned (a tool got detected). **Refresh-time pruning affects only which files would be *newly shipped* — it never deletes or proposes deleting an on-disk reference file.** "Prune" is a ship-time filter, not an operation on existing files (File Preservation Policy).

### `AGENTS.md` + tool configs + indexes

When `AGENTS.md` or `path-references` is `stale`/`missing`, regenerate deterministically:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-agents-md.sh
bash scripts/generate-tool-configs.sh --all
bash scripts/refresh-derived.sh references triggers
```

These generators carry their own preservation guards, which is why they may write in place: `generate-agents-md.sh` refuses to overwrite an AGENTS.md that lacks its auto-generated marker and preserves `## Custom:` sections when regenerating its own output; `generate-tool-configs.sh` applies the same marker-refusal rule per output file. **A marker-less config (AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, `.windsurfrules`, …) is hand-curated — leave it alone, list it under "Preserved hand-authored files", and note it as a Needs review item if the plan flagged it.** Never pass `--force` to reconcile a staleness row; a row that cannot be reconciled without `--force` means the file is not MTK's to regenerate. `refresh-derived.sh` is idempotent and silent on no-op, so running it at the end of this step regardless of the trigger is safe and keeps `.claude/references.index` / `.claude/triggers.index` in sync with whatever STEP 3 just touched.

### `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/*`

Never rewritten in place, regardless of staleness reason (version-drift footer or stale dependency mentions). Compute the fresh template content as `setup-bootstrap` would, then hand it to STEP 4 — CLAUDE.md and every `.claude/rules/*.md` file always go through the diff-proposal contract, never a direct `Write`.

## STEP 4: Engineer-Edited Files

For every file STEP 3 regenerated or would regenerate (`architecture-principles.md`, `conventions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, each `.claude/rules/*.md`, `.claude/detected-tools.json`), resolve `ancestor` / `current` / `fresh` and apply `.claude/references/regen-diff-contract.md` exactly as written there — do not re-derive or restate its classification, diff-proposal, or cache-update rules here. In short: files unchanged since the last generation overwrite cleanly; files an engineer edited get their MTK delta proposed hunk-by-hunk via `AskUserQuestion`, never force-merged; hunks that no longer apply cleanly land under **Needs review** with the conflicting region quoted; protected files (`manifest.protected`) that this run has no business touching are reported `SKIP`.

Run this step for every candidate file even if STEP 3 judged the underlying content unchanged — the contract's own `current == ancestor` check is what decides "safe to overwrite," and that decision belongs to the contract, not to this step.

When applying resolved content to `.claude/references/architecture-principles.md`, write via a temp file promoted through the shrink guard (S3.16), same as `setup-audit`:

```bash
. hooks/lib/shrink-guard.sh
mtk_guarded_write .claude/references/architecture-principles.md "$tmp"
```

## STEP 5: Grounding

For every doc whose on-disk copy STEP 4 actually changed (wholesale stock overwrite or applied hunks):

1. **Sync Impact stamp.** Refresh the `<!-- mtk-stamp -->` block with the three re-run fields, computed by diffing the regenerated doc against its previous on-disk version **before** writing:
   ```
   <!-- mtk-stamp
   audited-against: <sha>
   audited-at: <ISO8601>
   mtk-version: <version>
   previous-stamp: <previous audited-against sha, or "none">
   sections-changed: <comma-separated H2 titles, or "none">
   claims-delta: +<added> ~<modified> -<removed>
   -->
   ```
2. **Verify-claims retry loop.** Run `bash scripts/verify-claims.sh <doc>`. Read `.claude/.mtk-cache/weak-claims-<doc>.json`. For each downgraded claim, make exactly **one** re-derivation attempt: re-locate correct evidence (fix the anchor — right path, right glob, right symbol), or, if it truly cannot be evidenced, delete the claim line — **but only if the line is byte-identical to the `fresh` template's version** (i.e., this run generated it). A line the engineer authored or modified is never deleted by the retry loop: leave the downgraded tag in place and let the engineer decide. Every deleted line must be itemized in the STEP 6 report. Rewrite the doc and run `verify-claims.sh` once more. Downgrades that survive the second pass are accepted and reported in STEP 6 — never loop a third time, and never re-upgrade a tag without a resolving anchor.
3. **Load `.claude/setup-answers.json`.** If present, treat its contents as authoritative human input. Any rule or claim sourced from it must keep the evidence-anchor convention (`Evidence: engineer interview — .claude/setup-answers.json (hard_nevers)`), which always resolves for `verify-claims.sh` (it checks the path exists before content-grep) — engineer-stated rules are therefore never auto-downgraded by the verify pass. Regeneration must not drop or reword a rule sourced from this file. If a fresh scan finding contradicts an interview answer, do not silently pick a side — emit a **Needs review** item citing both the answer and the contradicting finding.

## STEP 6: Report

Print a summary with four counts — `Updated`, `Created`, `Preserved (untouched)`, `Needs review` — followed by an itemized list of every needs-review item. Apply the same preservation reporting rules as `setup-bootstrap` STEP 5: list every preserved hand-authored file (or "none found"), and if any MTK-owned file was retired this run, list it explicitly under a "Retired prior MTK files" heading — never let a retirement pass silently.

```
✅ MTK SETUP REFRESH COMPLETE

Plan:      [N] fresh, [N] stale, [N] missing, [N] unstamped/unknown

Updated:            [N]
  [file — RESULT from regen-diff-contract, e.g. "architecture-principles.md — scoped regen, 3 sections re-derived"]
Created:            [N]
  [file — e.g. "conventions.md — was missing"]
Preserved (untouched): [N]
  [file — reason, e.g. "CLAUDE.md — PROPOSED (2 hunks: 2 applied, 0 skipped)" or "conventions.md — fresh, no drift"]
Needs review:       [N]
  [file — hunk description and quoted conflicting region, per regen-diff-contract]

Preserved hand-authored files (untouched):
  [nested CLAUDE.md, custom rules/references outside the standard set — or "none found"]
Retired prior MTK files (explicitly removed this run):
  [MTK-owned files this run superseded — or "none"]

Next steps:
  1. Resolve each Needs review item — the conflicting region is quoted above
  2. Re-run `/mtk-setup --check` to confirm the plan is now clean
```

## Verification

- `bash scripts/setup-refresh-plan.sh --json` ran and its output drove every scoping decision in STEP 3 (no ad-hoc staleness judgment).
- No file outside the plan's `stale`/`missing` artifacts (or the derived AGENTS.md/tool-config/index set) was modified; no non-MTK file was modified or deleted.
- Every doc rewritten in STEP 3/4 carries a refreshed `<!-- mtk-stamp -->` with `previous-stamp` / `sections-changed` / `claims-delta` populated.
- `scripts/verify-claims.sh` ran per refreshed doc, including the one-retry loop where downgrades occurred.
- Every engineer-edited file went through `.claude/references/regen-diff-contract.md` — no direct `Write` to `CLAUDE.md` or any `.claude/rules/*.md`, and no `git merge-file --union` anywhere in this run.
- The STEP 6 report was printed with all four counts and an itemized needs-review list (or explicit "none").
