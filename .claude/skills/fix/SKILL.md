# MTK Fix — Lightweight Task Loop

## MTK File Resolution

Resolve MTK skill/reference/script paths per `.claude/references/mtk-file-resolution.md` unless the router already stated `MTK_ROOT=<path>` this session; `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/tech-stack`, `.claude/rules/`, `tasks/`, `docs/`, `.mtk/` stay project-relative.

---

## Overview

A lightweight, bounded fix loop for 1-3 file changes: load context, reproduce, write the failing test, fix the root cause, verify. Invoked by the `/mtk` router when the user says "fix", "bug", "broken", or similar. Composes `context-engineering`, `security-and-hardening` (when the fix touches auth, audited state, secrets, or infra), and the active `tech-stack-{stack}` skill.

## When To Use

- Bug fixes
- Validation tweaks
- Query fixes
- Small config changes
- Renames or narrow refactors that stay within 1-3 files

If the work grows beyond 3 files, introduces new architecture, or needs a formal change manifest, stop and escalate per the Scope Guard below: several independent fixes, or a mechanical sweep (renames, formatting) past 3 files, go to `batch-fix` (its mechanical mode: `batch-fix` → Proportionality check); one growing change goes to `implement`. The 3-file limit has no exception.

## Workflow

Follow the phases below in order. Each phase loads what it needs and no more.

### Load Context (Progressive Disclosure)

1. Follow `.claude/skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md` — it resolves the stack for the target paths (pass a target file, not `$PWD`, when the fix sits in a subtree) and loads the stack skill. If neither `AGENTS.md` nor `CLAUDE.md` exists, stop and tell the engineer to run `/mtk-setup`.
2. Read only what the fix needs:
   - **Always:** the coding guidelines from the tech stack's `## Reference Files`
   - **If fix touches data layer/ORM:** the tech stack skill's `## ORM & Data Layer Guidance` (and `## Framework Patterns` for handler/HTTP code)
   - **If fix touches auth/secrets/financial:** `.claude/references/domain-finance.md` (finance and security supplement)
   - **If adding tests:** the testing supplement from the tech stack's `## Reference Files`
   - **Before commit:** `.claude/references/pre-commit-review-list.md` if present
3. Resolve and scan relevant lessons. When `scripts/learnings.sh` is present, prefer the structured query (5-layer filter — proximity / recurrence / severity / validity / phase) over the flat markdown file:
   ```bash
   # Resolve the script: project copy first, else the plugin's copy.
   LS="$([ -n "${MTK_HELPER_ROOT:-}" ] && echo "$MTK_HELPER_ROOT/scripts/learnings.sh" || ([ -f scripts/learnings.sh ] && echo scripts/learnings.sh || echo "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/learnings.sh"))"
   bash "$LS" query --phase implement --files "<target file paths>" --max 8
   ```
   Falls back to scanning `tasks/lessons.md` directly when the script is absent from both the project and the plugin (older repos).
4. Read the target file and its closest neighbors before editing.

### Execute The Fix Workflow

1. **Reproduce** — capture the failing test, error output, or behavioral evidence before editing, and state the suspected root cause.
2. **Failing test first** — for a bug fix, write the smallest test that fails for the reported reason, then make it pass. Mechanical edits (rename, format) skip this.
3. **Fix the root cause**, not the symptom, with the smallest change that matches the local pattern.
4. **Verify** with the active tech stack's commands: the build, then the tests for the changed area.

**Test policy.**
- Pick the test level from the stack skill's `## Test Level Guidance`; unit for pure logic, integration where behavior depends on framework infrastructure.
- Never use an in-memory provider to prove database semantics (constraints, transactions, query translation); use the stack's real-provider pattern from `## ORM & Data Layer Guidance`.
- When a library's behavior is uncertain, read its real exception/return surface from local source (decompiled package, SDK, in-repo docs) before trusting the call; say what stayed unverified.
- If a test fails, debug the implementation; do not weaken the test or relax its assertion. After repeated failed attempts, stop and explain what is blocking.

### Scope Guard

If scope grows past 1-3 files, **stop and self-escalate** instead of expanding in place. Where it escalates depends on *why* it grew:

- **Several independent trivial fixes, no new contract** — the growth is just more small unrelated fixes (e.g. a review threw up 5 nits across 5 files) → escalate to **`batch-fix`**.
- **One growing change past 3 files, a new handler/entity/slice, a new/changed public contract, or architectural re-planning** → escalate to **`implement`**.

**Self-escalation procedure:**

1. Summarize what's been discovered so far (root cause, files identified, why the scope grew).
2. Invoke the router with the original fix description plus the discovered scope, using the marker the router catches:
   - To batch-fix: `Skill(skill: "mtk", args: "<original description> — escalated from fix (batch): <short reason>")`
   - To implement: `Skill(skill: "mtk", args: "<original description> — escalated from fix: <short reason>")`
3. Do not continue editing. The router picks the target from the escalation marker.
4. If the engineer prefers to keep the fix narrow, they can override by re-invoking `/mtk fix` with a scoped-down description.

Silent scope creep past 3 files is a red flag — always escalate rather than quietly expanding.

### Final Report

Report briefly:

- files changed
- root cause
- tests added or updated
- build result
- relevant test result

## Critical Rules

1. Read before editing.
2. Match the local codebase pattern.
3. Do not gold-plate unrelated improvements.
4. Escalate instead of letting a quick fix become a hidden feature project.

## Verification

- [ ] Root cause was reproduced before fixing, and a bug fix has a test that failed first
- [ ] Change stayed within 1-3 files; escalated to batch-fix (several independent fixes) or implement (new slice/contract/re-planning) if scope grew
- [ ] Tests added or updated for the regression
- [ ] Build is clean and relevant tests pass
- [ ] Final report lists files changed, root cause, tests, and verification evidence
