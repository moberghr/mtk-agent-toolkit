# Context Engineering

## Active Stack

```!
echo "--- Tech Stack ---"
_rts="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-tech-stack.sh"; [ -f "$_rts" ] || _rts="scripts/resolve-tech-stack.sh"
if [ -f "$_rts" ]; then bash "$_rts" --explain "$PWD" 2>&1; echo; else cat .claude/tech-stack 2>/dev/null || echo "(not set)"; fi
if [ -f .claude/tech-stack-pm ]; then echo "--- Package Manager ---"; cat .claude/tech-stack-pm; fi
```

## Overview

Load the minimum context the current phase needs, from the right stack, and refresh it when the
scope changes. The constitution (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`) is already loaded by the harness; do
not re-read it.

## When To Use

- Phase 0 of `fix`, `batch-fix`, and `implement`, and at every later phase boundary
- Entering an unfamiliar area, or when new files enter scope

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the stack for the files in scope.** `bash scripts/resolve-tech-stack.sh <path>` is
   polyglot-aware (subproject `.claude/tech-stack` → root `.claude/tech-stack.map` glob → root
   file). Pass a representative target path, not `$PWD`, when the change sits in a subtree; add
   `--check <paths>` to warn when the resolved stack disagrees with the files. Then read
   `.claude/skills/tech-stack-{stack}/SKILL.md` for build/test commands and reference paths.
   If nothing resolves, infer with `bash scripts/setup-detect.sh --json` (read-only) and load the
   matching stack skill; if that is empty too, say the stack is unconfigured (suggest
   `/mtk-setup`) and continue in degraded mode.
2. **Load references for the current phase only.** Spec: `domain-finance.md` (finance and
   security supplement, only when scope touches auth/financial/infra) and the stack's testing
   supplement. Implementation: the stack's `## Reference Files` entries for the touched layers. Review:
   `pre-commit-review-list.md` if present. Read by section where one section is enough.
3. **`applyTo` matching.** Reference entries in `.claude/manifest.json` may declare an `applyTo`
   glob array. Test each file in scope (the spec's `change_manifest`, else
   `git diff --name-only HEAD`) against the globs with `case`/`fnmatch` semantics; load the
   references that match at least one file and skip the rest. References without `applyTo` load
   on demand per phase. Re-run the match when new files enter scope.
4. **Native `paths:` rules.** `.claude/rules/*.md` carry `paths:` frontmatter and Claude Code loads
   a rule only when a matching file is read or edited. Do not read every rule up front; when the
   task needs a rule whose paths did not match (a security pass, a release), read that one file.
5. Read the file to be changed and 2-3 neighbours that set the local pattern.
6. Independent reads go out in one message, not sequentially.

Bound tool output before pruning instructions: instructions are prompt-cached, tool output is
re-billed every turn. Model tiers per phase live in `.claude/references/model-routing.md`.

## Verification

- [ ] Stack resolved for the files in scope (not just the repo root)
- [ ] References loaded for the current phase only; `applyTo` matched against real touched files
- [ ] Local pattern files read before editing or reviewing
