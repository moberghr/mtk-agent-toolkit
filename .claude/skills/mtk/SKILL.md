# MTK — Unified Entry Point

You are a router. Classify the user's intent from their input, then load and follow the matching workflow skill inline. Do not do the work yourself — delegate by reading the target skill and following it end-to-end.

## Route Table

Match the user's input against these patterns. Check from top to bottom; first match wins.

**Order matters — do not "tidy" it.** `batch-fix` sits above `pre-commit-review` and `fix` on purpose: its multi-word phrases (`apply review findings`, `batch fix`, `several fixes`) contain those rows' single-word keywords (`review`, `fix`), so a lower position would let them shadow it. The PR-mining row sits above `pre-commit-review` for the same reason: "mine PR reviews" contains `review`. The `converge` row sits above the setup redirect so the bare `principles` keyword cannot turn it into a full setup run. `scripts/run-fixtures.sh` simulates first-match-wins precedence and will fail if the order regresses.

| Pattern (keywords / intent) | Route to | Example inputs |
|---|---|---|
| `escalated from fix (batch)` (internal marker: fix found multiple independent fixes) | `.claude/skills/batch-fix/SKILL.md` | — internal self-escalation only |
| `escalated from fix`, `escalated from batch-fix` (internal markers from Scope Guards) | `.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` | — internal self-escalation only |
| `batch fix`, `apply findings`, `apply review findings`, `corrective batch`, `several fixes`, `multiple fixes` | `.claude/skills/batch-fix/SKILL.md` | "apply these review findings", "run a batch fix over these nits" |
| `mine pr`, `pr mining`, `pr review mining`, `reviewer feedback`, `reviewers keep` | `.claude/skills/repo-health/SKILL.md` (PR-mining section) | "mine PR reviews", "what do reviewers keep repeating?" |
| `review`, `check`, `commit`, `staged`, `pre-commit`, `before I commit` | `.claude/skills/pre-commit-review/SKILL.md` | "review before commit", "check staged changes" |

| `help`, `commands`, `what can you do` | (print help below) | "help", "what commands are there?" |

## Route Disambiguation (negative boundaries)

Positive keyword matches collide on adjacent intents. These boundaries say when not to take
the obvious route — encoding the contested pairs measurably cuts misroutes.

| Route to… | …not… | …when |
|---|---|---|
| `fix` | `implement` | the change is 1–3 files with no new public contract; if it's feature-sized it's `implement`, if it's several small independent fixes it's `batch-fix` (ambig branch → ask once) |
| `batch-fix` | `fix` | the batch is more than 3 files OR multiple distinct independent fixes — too big for the single-change `fix` loop. A purely mechanical sweep past 3 files is no exception: it runs in batch-fix's mechanical mode |
| `batch-fix` | `implement` | the batch introduces no new public contract and no architecture; a finding that needs one escalates THAT finding to `implement` |
| `batch-fix` | `pre-commit-review` | the ask is "apply review findings" / "apply the review comments" — running the corrective-batch loop, not a staged-changes security gate; batch-fix's row sits above `pre-commit-review` so `review` cannot shadow it |
| `repo-health` | `pre-commit-review` | the ask is "mine PR reviews" / recurring reviewer feedback — repo-health's suggest-only PR-mining section, not a review of staged changes |
| `research-context` | `implement`/`fix` | the ask is an external/best-practice/version question ("what's the current way to…"), not a change to this repo |
| `pre-commit-review` | `code-review-and-quality` | the trigger is staged/about-to-commit; full PR/branch review is the workflow skill, not the pre-commit gate |
| `mtk-doctor` | `mtk-doctor --usage` | the ask is install health or "what's loaded right now"; usage/adoption/analytics over time is `--usage` |
| `instructions` (`capture`) | `handoff` | the target is AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md content; capturing session state to resume later is `handoff` |
| `instructions` (`capture`) | `lessons` (`capture`) | the finding is a fact about this repo (a command, a path, an env quirk) that belongs in the constitution; a reusable rule from a correction or a dead end is a lesson |
| `lessons` (`promote`) | `lessons` (`mine`) | a specific known lesson goes native memory → team; sweeping transcripts for candidates is `mine` |
| `lessons` (`refresh`) | `lessons` (`mine`) | auditing/retiring EXISTING lessons is `refresh`; harvesting NEW candidates from transcripts is `mine` |
| `/mtk-setup` | `implement`/`fix` | anything setup/bootstrap/audit/architecture-principles — always redirect to `/mtk-setup`, never absorb. Code drifting from the agreed principles ("converge") is `/mtk-setup --check`. Exceptions: `audit lessons` (lessons refresh) and `audit agents.md`/`audit claude.md` (instructions audit) are not setup |

## Routing Rules

1. **Strip flags first.** If the input starts with `--terse`, `--verbose`, `--staged-only`, `--preview`, `--merge`, `--non-interactive`, `--usage`, pass them through to the target skill.
2. **Unambiguous → route silently.** If the input matches exactly one row of the table, invoke immediately — no confirmation question.
3. **Escalation marker → route by marker (most specific first).** If the input contains `escalated from fix (batch)`, route to `batch-fix`. Otherwise, if it contains `escalated from fix` or `escalated from batch-fix`, route straight to `implement`. These markers are produced only by the `fix` / `batch-fix` Scope Guards.
4. **Ambiguous → ask, but only if genuinely ambiguous.** If input matches two rows with similar specificity (e.g., "fix the auth feature" — fix verb + feature-sized noun), ask one clarifying question: "Is this a small fix (1-3 files), a batch of small independent fixes, or a larger feature?" Do not ask for inputs that clearly match one row.
5. **No input → help.** If invoked with no argument, print the help text.
6. **Pass description through.** When loading the target skill, treat the user's original description as the task input — don't summarize or rephrase.
7. **Setup requests → redirect.** If the user asks for setup/bootstrap/audit, tell them to run `/mtk-setup` directly (with appropriate flags) rather than routing through mtk. An `audit` that matched an earlier row (`audit lessons`, `audit agents.md`, `audit claude.md`) is not a setup request; `converge` goes to `/mtk-setup --check`.

## Help Output

When the user asks for help or provides no input, respond with:

```
MTK — entry points:

  /mtk-setup                     → first-time setup (bootstrap + audit)
  /mtk-setup --audit             → re-run architecture audit
  /mtk-setup --merge             → merge multi-repo audits
  /mtk-setup --refresh           → drift-scoped refresh of all generated docs (--dry-run to preview)
  /mtk-setup --check             → read-only CI staleness gate + drift from the agreed principles
  /mtk-setup --update-guidelines → bump the pinned coding-guidelines SHA
  /mtk-doctor                    → install health check (--json, --fix, --usage)
  /lessons <mode>                → capture | mine | refresh | promote team lessons

  /mtk <description>             → everything else:
    /mtk review before commit      → pre-commit security review
    /mtk repo-health               → AI-readiness checklist + PR review mining
    /mtk fix <description>         → small fix (1-3 files)
    /mtk apply these findings      → batch-fix: several small independent fixes, one gate
    /mtk <feature description>     → full implementation workflow
    /mtk research <question>       → cited brief, grounded in this repo's versions
    /mtk audit AGENTS.md           → instructions audit (capture: "save what we learned")
    /mtk status                    → mtk-doctor: what's loaded and healthy
    /mtk usage stats               → mtk-doctor --usage

Update: MTK is distributed as a Claude Code plugin — use the plugin
manager to update rather than an in-repo update skill.
```

## Execution

Once matched, resolve the MTK root once per `.claude/references/mtk-file-resolution.md` and state it as a single line — `MTK_ROOT=<path>` — so the dispatched skill does not re-resolve. On a plugin install the path is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (substituted into this text at load time; it is not a Bash environment variable). Then read the target skill file and follow every step of that workflow. Do not summarize; do not skip verification. The target skill owns its own acceptance criteria.

If the route is `/mtk-setup` (setup family, including the `converge` row, which maps to `--check`), tell the user:

> "Setup lives at `/mtk-setup` — run that directly. Flags: `--audit` re-audits only, `--merge` unifies multi-repo audits, `--refresh` drift-refreshes all generated docs (`--dry-run` previews), `--check` is the read-only staleness gate, `--preview` shows planned changes, `--non-interactive` skips interview."

Do not add preamble or commentary before routing. Just route.
